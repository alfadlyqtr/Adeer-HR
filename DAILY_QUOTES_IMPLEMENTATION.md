# Daily Quotes Implementation

## ✅ What Was Added

Daily inspirational quotes have been added to **all dashboards** at the top, just like on the landing page.

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`src/components/DailyQuote.tsx`** - Reusable component that loads and displays rotating quotes
2. **`src/app/api/quotes/route.ts`** - API endpoint to serve quotes from the `quots` file

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/app/ceo/page.tsx`** - Added DailyQuote component
2. **`src/app/hr/page.tsx`** - Added DailyQuote component
3. **`src/app/manager/page.tsx`** - Added DailyQuote component
4. **`src/app/staff/page.tsx`** - Added DailyQuote component

## 🎨 Features

- **Auto-rotating quotes** - Changes every 60 seconds
- **Refresh button** - Click to get a random quote instantly
- **Smooth animations** - Quote transitions with fade in/out effects
- **Consistent styling** - Matches the landing page design with gradient background
- **Client-side loading** - Fetches quotes via API for better performance
- **Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Quote Loading:**
   - The `DailyQuote` component calls `/api/quotes` on mount
   - API reads the `quots` file from project root
   - Filters out empty lines and special characters
   - Returns clean quotes array

2. **Display:**
   - Uses the existing `QuotesRotator` component
   - Shows one quote at a time with auto-rotation
   - Includes refresh button for manual rotation
   - Displays in a styled card with gradient background

3. **Placement:**
   - Positioned at the top of each dashboard
   - Right after the welcome header
   - Before main dashboard content
