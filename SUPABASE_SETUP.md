# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Authentication Error Fix

The application is currently showing errors related to Supabase authentication:

```
[ERROR] Invalid Supabase credentials. Authentication will not work properly.
[ERROR] Failed to initialize Supabase client: {}
[ERROR] Login failed: {}
```

To fix these errors, you need to set up your Supabase credentials in a `.env.local` file.

## Steps to Fix:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

2. Replace the placeholders with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key.

3. If you don't have a Supabase project yet:
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Sign up and create a new project
   - Once your project is created, go to Project Settings > API
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
   - Paste them into your `.env.local` file

4. Restart your Next.js development server after setting up the `.env.local` file

## Temporary Solution

If you want to test the application without setting up Supabase:
1. Open the login page
2. Click on "Show Diagnostics" 
3. Enter your Supabase URL and key in the form fields
4. Click "Test Supabase Connection" to verify your credentials are working
